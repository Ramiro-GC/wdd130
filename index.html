            <p>My name is Ramiro González, I am 35 years old. I live in Treinta y Tres, Uruguay. I
                started learning english by myself at the age of 12, I loved this language so much
                that
                I kept on learning and practicing every day. Learning a foreign language opens a lot
                of
                opportunities, from education, work and cultural exchange that brings us closer to
                other
                comunities and allows us to meet new people. These are the main reasons why I want
                to
                learn more languages like German and Russian.</p>
